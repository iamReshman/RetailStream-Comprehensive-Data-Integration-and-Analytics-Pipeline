# RetailStream-Comprehensive-Data-Integration-and-Analytics-Pipeline
# 📌 Project Overview

RetailStream is a full-scale data engineering pipeline built on Apache Spark and Databricks to unify, clean, and analyze retail data from multiple sources (sales, features, stores). The project aims to solve the problem of delayed and fragmented insights in large retail chains by implementing an automated, production-ready pipeline that delivers actionable business intelligence.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Databricks** (Notebooks, Jobs, Spark SQL)
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**
- **AWS S3 (or Databricks FileStore)**
- **Delta Lake / Hive Tables**
- **Airflow / Prometheus (optional for orchestration & monitoring)**

## ⚙️ How the Pipeline Works

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Load datasets (`sales`, `features`, `stores`) from Databricks tables or FileStore (via UI upload).

### 2. **Cleaning & Type Conversion**
- Cast columns like `Date`, `Weekly_Sales`, `Unemployment`, etc., to appropriate formats.

### 3. **Data Integration**
- Join sales, features, and store datasets on keys like `Store`, `Date`, and `IsHoliday`.

### 4. **Transformation**
- Prepare a unified DataFrame called `retail_data` and register it as a Spark SQL temp view.

### 5. **Analysis**
- Run SQL queries to extract insights and answer all 10 business questions.

### 6. **Job Orchestration**
- Use **Databricks Jobs** to chain the notebooks into a workflow with dependencies.

### 7. **Monitoring**
- Display logs using `show()` in development.
- (Optional) Integrate **Prometheus/Grafana** or push logs to **CloudWatch** for production monitoring.

## 🚀 Running the Pipeline

### Option 1: Manual (Development Mode)
1. Upload your data using **“Create or Modify”** in Databricks.
2. Run each notebook in sequence:
   - `01_load_and_clean_data.ipynb`
   - `02_join_and_prepare_final_df.ipynb`
   - `03_run_analysis_queries.ipynb`
   - `04_monitor_and_log.ipynb` *(Optional)*

### Option 2: Automated Workflow (Production)
1. Go to **Jobs > Create Job** in Databricks
2. Add each notebook as a task
3. Set dependencies and schedule
4. Monitor via Job UI or set alerts

## 🧪 Sample Query (Department Performance)

```sql
SELECT 
  Department,
  AVG(Weekly_Sales) AS avg_sales,
  MAX(Weekly_Sales) AS max_sales,
  MIN(Weekly_Sales) AS min_sales
FROM retail_data
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY avg_sales DESC;
